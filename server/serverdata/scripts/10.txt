*Crafting
*House/fence building
*house walls and fences degenerate over time or if attacked
*house/fence material upgrades for stronger structures--wood,brick,stone,etc
*sailing(buy/make different boats if thats what is used)
*farming--different kinds of crops
*fishing(different/better things to fish for the farther out you go)
*farm animals buy/sell have babies--produce milk/eggs (horses,cows,chickens,sheep,etc)
*maybe after a certain amount of time after being born/bought farm animals die of old age(you can also kill them for meat at any time)
*more things to collect and sell/make things out of (honey, acorns, eggs from non-domestic birds,berries from berry bushes etc)
*wild animals that move from map to map (bears, wolves, etc)--maybe can hunt and sell furs
*place to buy and/or make different furniture and accessories for your house
*have different seasons or weather if possible?
*be able to see your levels in digging, chopping, etc
*different events/games--Example: Have a certain item berry, egg, acorn, whatever spawn randomly throughout the world at the "start" of the      event and whoever collects the most after a certain amount of time when the event comes to an end wins a prize(like an easter egg hunt)
*ride horses or make car type things that are faster than walking--worth either a lot of gold or a lot of supplies
*a chance to find some sort of treasure while digging (weapon,gold,rare jewel, fossil,etc)
*every now and then random fires that can spread/burn down houses that you have to put out
*weeds that grow in your yard and randomly throughout the world that can be cut down
*maybe in order to have energy to chop/dig/mine all the time you have to eat any edible item every now and then to keep up energy--different      items would have different energy values and can be sold for different price values--egg>berry etc and you could make even better items out          of other smaller items Example:           
     egg+milk+wheat=bread 
     tomato+lettuce+carrot=salad  
     bread+salad+any meat(fish,cow,chicken...)=sandwich
     bread is = to or close in value to salad and sandwich is > bread and salad
     there could be 3 level categories of food low energy foods (egg,milk,tomato,etc) which are used to make medium energy foods               (salad,bread,etc) which can then make high energy foods (sandwich,cake,etc)
	

PUZZLES:

*A room with walls randomly placed..some parts of the walls can be pushed some cant. You have to get a number of rocks each to a spot somewhere in the room..(if 4 rocks then there would be 4 different spots) if a boulder gets stuck somewhere then you would have to restart and try again

*There are a number of different colored balls. You have to push each into a hole one by one which then turns a tile or something similar to a different color depending on the color of the ball and order you push them in. And you have to make the tile a certain color(maybe it tells the color needed on a sign in the room.) and if when all balls are pushed in it is not the correct color you start again.

*There are a number of holes..say 5..and you choose a hole to go into. Then the next map there are 4 to choose from. The next 3 and then the last there are 2 and you have to figure out which holes are the correct ones to reach the end map. If you choose the wrong path then at the end there will be a ladder or something to climb back to the top and start again.
